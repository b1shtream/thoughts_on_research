research is like meditation; a cure for mental illness; answer to mysterious questions

### Excerpts that hits on spot:

When it comes to solving complex scientific problems, there is often a big gap of unexplored ideas in the range of "too risky to be funded by the government" and "too unexplored to start a company". For example, it is basically impossible to incentivize companies to work on classes of drugs that went off-patent; likewise, it is really hard to fund properly-powered clinical trials in academia.

The most profound leaps often emerge from such “frivolous” curiosity: feynman’s obsession with wobbly plates that led to breakthroughs in quantum electrodynamics or kepler’s fixation on the precise nesting of planetary orbits in polyhedra, which ultimately unraveled the laws of motion. we dream of a world that encourages this kind of pure exploration—a world where entire afternoons might be spent studying molecular dynamics or thinking up new computational paradigms, not because it will yield a new app or business model, but because the act of understanding is, in itself, transcendent. - [https://homebrew.nyc/manifesto](https://homebrew.nyc/manifesto)
